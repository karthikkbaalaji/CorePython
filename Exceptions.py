# modify the exception handler in your calculate function to
# include an else block and move code to the else block except code which may throw an exception
# extend your calculator to include a log() function where the second argument is the base,
# i.e,. calculate(49.0, 7, 'log') = log7(49.0) = 2.0
# be sure you have a try/except/else block for your log() function
# (remember that logb(x) = loga(x)/loga(b))
