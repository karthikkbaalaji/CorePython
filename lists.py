#write a Python program to maintain two lists and loop
#until the user wants to quit
#your program should offer the user the following options:
#   add an item to list 1 or 2
#   remove an item from list 1 or 2 by value or index
#   reverse list 1 or list 2
#   display both lists
#EXTRA: add an option to check if lists are equal, even if
#contents are not in the same order (i.e, if list 1 is [3, 2,
#'apple', 4] and list 2 is [2, 3, 4, 'apple'], you
#should indicate they are the same)
