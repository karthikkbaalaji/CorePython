# CorePython

This repository contains Core Python codes for basic python concepts.

### 1. String functions:
  - Python program which prompts the user for a string and a stride (increment), and alternately makes the string upper case and lower case, 
stride characters at a time. 

### 2. Additional String functions:
  - Program to:  
   a. Have the user enter two strings and indicate whether either string appears at the end of the other string, e.g.,"Bigelow", "low" => YES or "mart", "Minimart" => YES   
    b. Extra...modify your solution for #1 so that case is ignored, i.e.,"Mart", "Minimart" => YES 

### 3. Loops:
  - a. Program to have the user enter a string, then loop through the string to generate a new string in which every character is duplicated   
      e.g., "hello" => "hheelllloo". 

### 4. Prime Numbers:
  - a. Program to Print prime numbers if number is not prime, print the number's divisors. 

### 5. Lists:
  - a. Program to demonstrate list manipulations.
