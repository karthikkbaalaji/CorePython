# CorePython

This repository contains Core Python codes for basic python concepts.

### 1. String functions:
  - Python program which prompts the user for a string and a stride (increment), and alternately makes the string upper case and lower case, 
stride characters at a time. 

### 2. Additional String functions:
  - Program to:  
    a. Have the user enter two strings and indicate whether either string appears at the end of the other string, e.g.,"Bigelow", "low" => YES or "mart", "Minimart" => YES
    b. Extra...modify your solution for #1 so that case is ignored, i.e.,"Mart", "Minimart" => YES 

### 3. Loops:
  - a. Program to have the user enter a string, then loop through the string to generate a new string in which every character is duplicated   
      e.g., "hello" => "hheelllloo". 

### 4. Prime Numbers:
  - a. Program to Print prime numbers if number is not prime, print the number's divisors. 

### 5. Lists:

    - write a Python program to maintain two lists and loop until the user wants to quit:
      your program should offer the user the following options:
    a. add an item to list 1 or 2
    b. remove an item from list 1 or 2 by value or index
    c. reverse list 1 or list 2
    d. display both lists
    EXTRA: add an option to check if lists are equal, even if contents are not in the same order (i.e, if list 1 is [3, 2,'apple', 4] and list 2 is [2, 3, 4, 'apple'],you should indicate they are the same)

### 6. Remove List Duplicates:
