# CorePython
   This repository contains Core Python codes for basic python concepts   
   1. String functions:
Python program which prompts the user for a string and a stride (increment), and alternately makes the string upper case and lower case, 
stride characters at a time.
   2. Additional String functions:
 Program to:
    a. Have the user enter two strings and indicate whether either string appears at the end of the other string, e.g.,
      "Bigelow", "low" => YES
      "mart", "Minimart" => YES
    b. Extra...modify your solution for #1 so that case is ignored, i.e.,
      "Mart", "Minimart" => YES
